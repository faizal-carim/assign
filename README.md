# assign
A sample Spring project that I created to meet these requirements

This will store as entities in in-memory db(h2)
A. As a User, I want to be able to upload a PDF Document, so that I can later perform other actions with it (e.g. view it, edit it, remove it etc)
B. As a User, I want to be able to remove my uploaded Document, so that I exercise my GDPR "Right to be forgotten"
C. As a User, I want to be able to be able to view all my uploaded documents, so that I can select one and view it

This will go to other repo https://my-json-server.typicode.com/faizal-carim/posts/
A. As a User, I want to create a Post and associate it with an existing Document that I have uploaded in the Bank's system, so that other Users can later engage and comment
B. As a User, I want to be able to view the Posts that are associated with a Document, so that I can read them
C. As a User, I want to create Comments and associate them with Documents that I have uploaded in the Bank's system, so that I can respond to Posts
